This post is a document about the video stream app that I made through [Modern React with Redux][udemy-react].

### App Features
* Navigator with routing
* Login/Logout with Google OAuth to create, edit, delete a stream/channel
* List of all the streams with a simple description underneath it
* Detail pages to show a streamed video
* Every user can create unlimited streams/channels that they can stream to

The source of this post and code is from [Modern React with Redux][udemy-react].
